## **Description**

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to change our ways of life, new opportunities emerge. The Utah House has been debating House Bill 203. If passed, this will allow certain Utah businesses with existing liquor and business licenses to conduct curb-side and home-delivery sales of certain beer. In the age of Doordash, Uber Eats, and Grub Hub, welcome to Bier Run!

Connecting the thirsty home consumer with the licensed vendor, Bier Run allows:

* Customers to quickly and easily browse inventory and place orders
* Vendors to quickly and easily review, fulfill, and deliver orders
* Through a secure, and easy-to-use application

## **Usage**

* Customers: Sign up for a free account or log in if you have ordered with us previously, select your desired beer options, place your order, and relax while our licensed vendor partners take care of your order.
* Drivers: Your licensed employer will send your information for validation to our admin team for registration and signup. Log in to the site, select an order, print the pdf ticket, and  fulfill and deliver the order in accordance with your employer's internal processes.

## **Technology**

This project uses the following notable libraries and packages:

* node, express, and react servers
* pdfMake for quickly creating pdf files
* react-spring for visually stunning animations
* react-modal for easy-to-use modal components and integration
